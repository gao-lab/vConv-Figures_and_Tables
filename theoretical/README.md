# genrate the results
run "python runSimuIC.py" to get the relationship between P_real and P_ideal on kernel length
run "python CNN.py" to get the relationship between kernel length and convolutional neural network,
and it could generate the figures in supplementary.Fig.12H-I
# genrate figures
run "statisticICsimuNumerical.py" to get the figures in supplementary.Fig.12D-G
